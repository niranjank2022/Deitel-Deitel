# CH02 - Structured Program Development in C

## Concepts covered...
<br>

- Pseudocode
- Control Structures
    - Sequence structure
        - Statements in a sequential order
    - Selection structure
        - single selection - *if*
        - double selection - *if/else*
        - multiple selection - *switch*
    - Repetition structure
        - *while*
        - *do/while*
        - *for*
- Conditional Operator
    > *Condition*  **?**  *if_true*  **:**  *if_false*
- Approaches in Repetition
    - Counter -controlled
    - Sentinel -controlled
- Cast operator
    ```
     Temporarily converts the variable after this operator into the mentioned data-type
     Eg: (float), (int)
    ```
- Assignment, Increment and Decrement operators
